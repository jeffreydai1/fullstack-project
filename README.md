## Structure of the repository:
puzzles contains all the actual code


## To run the website:
<p>
first make sure you have Node.js installed. To check, run:
```
$ node -v
```
If you don't have Node.js installed, download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ <br>
Once Node.js is installed, navigate to the puzzles directory, then run
```
$ node sitescript.js
```
Then in your web browser, go to this link: http://localhost:3000

You should see the home page. To interact with the website:
1. register an account by putting in your username of choice and password. If your username is already taken, then you must enter a new one. NOTE: DO NOT USE A REAL PERSONAL PASSWORD, use something like password123
2. Once you have succesfully registered an account, log in using that information
2. Answer the puzzle, if you answer enough you might just climb onto the leaderboard!

Since the database the website uses to store user information is a mongoDB cloud database, you will see the usernames and scores of other people who have used the website before!
